I developed 3 Mini Projects to develop a fundemental understanding of the Python programming language before tackling more intricate projects.

Project 1: Pig Game - Each player keeps rolling the dice and each roll adds points to their score. Once they decide to end their turn the points they have accumulated are added on to their total score. However, if they roll a 1 their turn is cut short and they gain no points for that turn. First to 50 wins.

Project 2: Mad Lib Generator -  Enter replacement words with the prompts given to create a story that includes your own words.

Project 3: Math Quiz Game - Generate 10 unique math questions only using simple operators. You must get each question right in order to proceed to the next question. Once you have completed 10 questions you are given a time so that you can keep attempting and improving.
